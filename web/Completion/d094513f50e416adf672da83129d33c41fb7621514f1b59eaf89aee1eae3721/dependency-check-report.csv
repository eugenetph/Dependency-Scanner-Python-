Python includes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. The Standard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce programming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in Free Python Games are implemented using Python and its Turtle module.  Starting in 2012, Free Python Games began as an after school program to teach programming to inner-city youth. The goal was to have fun as much as it was to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety of settings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps.  The games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computers running Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyed learning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games.
